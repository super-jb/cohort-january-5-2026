# Comments

Avoid the use of code comments. Instead, use descriptive classes, methods or functions.


# Tests

Tests use Microsoft Testing Platform. That's relevant to run and collect test logs.

`dotnet run -p tests/OutputDiagnostics.Core.Tests --output detailed --filter-query "/OutputDiagnostics.Core.Tests/OutputDiagnostics.Core.Tests.DiagnosticMessages/OrderProcessorTests/ProcessOrder_WithInvalidCustomer_ProvidesContextualFailureInfo"`

### Naming

Follow the snake case convention (Should_do_when_something)

### Mocks

Prefer NSubstitute.
